## NullP

**NullP** or Null programms are programms mainly focused on networking and stuff like that Im making this becouse I want to learn more cybersecurity and I think making my own tools that I test on RPi C server is great for learning. Use those programms wisely becouse it can cause some dangerous situations when miss used. Mainly the DoS attack.
