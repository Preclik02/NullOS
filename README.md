## NullOS

**NullOS** is OS builded by me (preclik02) and I kinda wanted to make this in my 18 or older but I once sat down to my desk and started from scratch building bootloader and basic kernel witch displayd basic text it was a W for me in those days. Exactly 7 days leater Im writing this with the ecosystem ready to go and the iso image can be found there [iso image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cBVbOlewNOse5yyd78FLZY36Vqezob5k/view?usp=drive_link) (defalut login: username: **null_user** password: **NullUser**) and if you wanna download and try the ecosystem for yourself you can using the **Null.sh** file witch is inclded in this repo just make sure you have those things ---> G++/Gcc/bash and thats it (I think) so try it run it for youreslf and if it errors tell me on email **nulldecode0@gmail.com** where you can also make the cipher I made for fun and write the .null files in there that works like C programs. I tell more about the NullC in the readme that is in the folder. For the challange ---> you create 2 files 1st for the full alfabeth of Null and than 2nd file witch include basic code.null that prints out Hello world when compiled using Nullc. If you do this challenge and you send the files to the email I will send you discord ivite link and there will be a chanel for developers where you can anwser some questions and I will think about having you included in my dev team.
